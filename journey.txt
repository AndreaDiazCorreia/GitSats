"The path has been marked, not by signs, but by the spirit of those who traveled before us. A word, once etched into the very essence of this journey, now remains only in our memories. It guided us like a CARAVANA under the stars, invisible yet ever-present, erased from the pages but not from the legacy of our expedition."
